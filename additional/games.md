This game is similar in respect to the human resource machine but here you control a group of people. Like the other game you make a program using a sequence of commands. This will teach concepts of multithreading, where multiple processes are executing simultaneously to perform one task.

The game studio Zachtronics has a number of interesting games that will teach you various programming concepts. Each of them is really nicely themed and really polished. Included in all games are also leaderboards that compare you to the other players that have solved the same puzzle.

Some of my favorites:
