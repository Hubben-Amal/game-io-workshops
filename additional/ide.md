An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a computer program to help you write code.
It can be as simple as a text editor but often it has some specific features to make development easier.
In this page I will explain how to set up Visual Studio Code for Phaser development.

## Installing Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code can be installed via this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Installing extension
Install the Live Server extension for VS Code.

After installation you will see a button in the bottom right that says **Go Live**.
Clicking it will start a local server which will host your project on http://localhost:5500/.
