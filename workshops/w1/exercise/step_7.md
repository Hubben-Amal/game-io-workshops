That is the end for the guided part of this exercise but there are plenty of things to add to our game to make it more fun and polished.

Some ideas:
* Increasing difficulty over time 
  * by increasing the speed of the pillars over time
  * creating more pillars
  * introduce randomness in pillar placements with random numbers ([see](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Math.RandomDataGenerator.html))
* Using physics to animate the bouncing
* More accurate collision detection
* Replacing the rectangles and circles by sprites
