In this exercise we will improve the game from the exercise of the last workshop and add:
* sprites
* physics
* dynamic content
* animation
* sound
* ui

If you did not finish the previous [exercise]({{ "workshops/w1/exercise" | relative_url }}) it is recommended to do so first as we will start from the code we have written previously. If you lost your progress or don't want to go through the last exercise you can start from this [fiddle](TODO).
